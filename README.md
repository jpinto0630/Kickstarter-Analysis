# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This is a requested analysis conducted on Kickstarter campaigns to gauge their success rates and relative performances. 
### Purpose
Louise has launched a Kickstarter campaign as has achieved a certain level of success in a short amount of time, she is seeking further insight into the variables that are present in a successful campaign. The goal of this project is to help Louise analyze how other theater plays performed during their Kickstarter campaigns, specifically in relation to launch dates and funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was conducted on a data set comprised of identifying and performance indicating variables for over 4,000 kick started campaigns. Our initial 13 data variables were :
```id, name, blurb, goal, pledged, outcomes, country, currency, deadline, launched at, staff pick, backers count,	spotlight ``` 
a further set of 8 variables were created to better filter and display data points, they were the following: 
```Category and Subcategory, Percentage Funded, Average Donation, Parent Category, Subcategory, Date Created Conversion, Date Ended Conversion Column, Year ```
With the data further filtered we were able to run the two requested analysis: Theater Outcome By Launch Date and Outcomes Based On Goals. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Our Analysis based on Launch date aimed to find a relationship between theater Kickstarter campaign launch dates and goal outcomes. The data appears to show that theater Kickstarter campaigns launched in the summer months tended to be more successful. Inversely the data seems to suggest the worst time to launch a campaign is October and the general trend continues for fall/early winter. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Our Analysis based on Goal Amount aimed to find a relationship between the success of theater plays and the goal amount of Kickstart campaigns. The data suggests that Kickstarter campaigns with lower goal amounts tends to be much more successful. Additionally, the data also seem to indicate that there is a spike in successes for campaign in the $30,000 to $44,999 range, however the number of campaigns compared to the lower goal amount ones is significantly lower. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were no particularly challenging components to the analysis, however there are some limitations to the data set. Mainly the data we are working with is only for 2014 to 2017, the numbers from 2017 -present may significantly impact the outcomes and end conclusions of the analysis we conducted.
