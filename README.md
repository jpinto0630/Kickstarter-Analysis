# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This is a requested analysis conducted on Kickstarter campaigns to gauge their success rates and relative performances. 
### Purpose
Louise has launched a Kickstarter campaign as has achieved a certain level of success in a short amount of time, she is seeking further insight into the variables that are present in a successful campaign. The goal of this project is to help Louise analyze how other theater plays performed during their Kickstarter campaigns, specifically in relation to launch dates and funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was conducted on a data set comprised of identifying and performance indicating variables for over 4,000 kick started campaigns. Our initial 13 data variables were :
```id, name, blurb, goal, pledged, outcomes, country, currency, deadline, launched at, staff pick, backers count,	spotlight ``` 
a further set of 8 variables were created to better filter and display data points, they were the following: 
```Category and Subcategory, Percentage Funded, Average Donation, Parent Category, Subcategory, Date Created Conversion, Date Ended Conversion Column, Year ```


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
